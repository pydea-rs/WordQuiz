We used django as the backend for this service. The backend is a REST API that is used by the frontend to register ads and get the ads.

## Installation

First things first, install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run this project simply run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/` to see the project.

# Notes:
* This not my project. Its a student project with some forced naming conventions. I was just allowed the group5 app and the database is pre-initialized and shared.
I couldn't even define models other than the 3 or 4 that was allowed (So the exam part and its result check is all handled in frontend and with js,
cause i couldn't use my defined models Questions and Exam so that i could handle it on backend side.). or even creating layouts.
So the not being a well-cleaned code is not on me, i did my best :).
This is just an illustration that you can blockmy way even with such idiotic limitations :)
