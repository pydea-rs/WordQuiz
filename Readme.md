Live demo available @ <a href="https://cat-rare-cupcake.glitch.me/">Words Salad Glitch Demo</a>

but Locally you can:
<hr />
First things first, install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Would be better to:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations

```


```bash
python manage.py migrate

```

Finally:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You know the rest with your port 8000.

<h1> Hear me now </h1>
<hr />

* This not my project. Its a student project with some forced naming conventions. I was just allowed the group5 app and the database is pre-initialized and shared.<br>

* I couldn't even define models other than the 3 or 4 that was allowed (So the exam part and its result check is all handled in frontend and with js,<br>
    cause i couldn't use my defined models Questions and Exam so that i could handle it on backend side.). or even creating layouts.
* So the not being a well-cleaned code is not on me, i did my best :).

* This is just an illustration that you can blockmy way even with such idiotic limitations : )

Fuck you and have a nice day.
